# Result calculation
# There's vulnerable flows in each vuln repo
	# Can be more than one vulnerable flow
	# One or more flows is one vulnerability
		# Can be decided based on the sink. On sink can be one vulnerability
  
# Check sinks on each flow in flow pormpt
# Each identified sink should be on vuln

# We should also check the sources
	# Some flows to a sink might be missed, but other flows might go to the same sinks
	# Manually check the source specification
# Do the same for sinks if the time is there
